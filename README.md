# Cochlea Transmission Line

This repo is a MWE implementation of the Epp 2010 cochlea model for experimenting with the final implementation.

## Running the model

To run the model, execute the script `scripts/run_ctl.jl`. The script takes one positional argument for a configuration file.
The configuration file defines the model parameters and solver parameters as well as a destination to save the data after a run.
See `params/test.yaml` for an example configuration file.
```sh
julia --project=. scripts/run_ctl.jl params/example.yaml
```
